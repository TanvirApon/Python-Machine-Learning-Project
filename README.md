# Python Machine Learning Project
This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on the development of classification-based models using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and basic machine learning techniques.


# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop classification models using real-world data. The project requirements include:
Using Python programming language
Implementing classification-based models
Working with a real dataset with a minimum of 2000 instances
Performing data preprocessing, including data cleaning
Conducting exploratory data analysis
Implementing the following models:
      Naive Bayes
      K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
      Decision Tree
      Logistic Regression
      Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  Comparing the classifiers based on their predictive accuracy

# Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project should meet the following criteria:

    It should be a real dataset with a minimum of 2000 instances.
    Provide a valid URL as the data source.
    Include a description of the dataset, explaining its features and target variable.

# Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis

This section of the project involves data preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis. Here are the key components to cover:

    Data preprocessing steps, such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and dealing with outliers.
    Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
    Utilize appropriate plotting techniques where necessary to visualize the data and its characteristics.

# Model Development

In this section, the focus is on developing machine learning models. The models to be implemented are:

    Naive Bayes
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    Decision Tree
    Logistic Regression
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The development process for each model should be explained, including the necessary code and screenshots. Additionally, relevant plots should be included where necessary to visualize the results.
Discussion and Conclusion

In the final section of the project, a comparison among the different models is presented. Key components to cover include:

    Compare the models based on their performance and predictive accuracy.
    Include relevant plots to visualize and support the comparison.
    Provide personal observations and draw conclusions based on the project outcomes.
