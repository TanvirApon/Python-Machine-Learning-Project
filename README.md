# Python-Machine-Learning-Project
This project was a task of university which in on Python, Pandas, Numpy, ML Basic


Project: Classification based Machine learning Model Development
Deadline: Lab exam week (in the lab class)

project requiremnents:
	- Python
	- Classification based Model
	- a real data set (minimum 2000 instances)
	- data preprossesing (e.g. data cleaning)
	- Exploratory data analysis
	- Models:
		- naive bayes
		- knn
		- decision tree
		- logistic regression
		- svm
	- comparison among the clasifiers
		- predicive accuracy
